### Hi there, I'm Derek

## Some things about me:

- I'm avid outdoorsman: rock climbing 🧗 , hiking (PCT 2015) 🏔️ , camping 🏕️ - you name it!
- My biggest hobby is programming 💻 and building lots of small, limited-purpose projects
- I enjoy cooking 🍳 and foods such as ginger beer, root beer, and ice cream!
- I've been to Turkey <img width="26px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Flag_of_Turkey.svg" /> twice (so far) and enjoyed it so much that I'm trying to learn Turkish (Türkçe) & share the culture with others

## Some of my biggest & most popular projects:

- 📅 [Bulk Edit Calendar Events](http://bulkeditcalendarevents.com) - a desktop program for editing Google Calendar events in bulk
- <img width="26px" src="https://icon-icons.com/icons2/1195/PNG/96/1490889653-reddit_82537.png" /> [MountainProject](https://github.com/derekantrican/MountainProject) - an HTML scraper and reddit bot to link [MountainProject.com](https://mountainproject.com) and various climbing subreddits, replying automatically to posts with climbing information
